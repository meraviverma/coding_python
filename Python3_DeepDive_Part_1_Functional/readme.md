# üêç Python Core Concepts

Welcome to the **Python Core Concepts** repository!  
This repo serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding key Python language features, especially those that often confuse or surprise even experienced developers.

## üìò Topics Covered

| #  | Topic                                 | Description |
|----|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1  | **Variables & References**            | Understanding how variables are references to objects in memory. |
| 2  | **Namespaces & Scopes**               | Global, local, and built-in scopes explained clearly with examples. |
| 3  | **Python Numeric Types**              | Integers, floats, complex numbers, and type coercion. |
| 4  | **Python Boolean Type**               | Truthy/falsy values, `and`/`or` short-circuit behavior, and subtle logic traps. |
| 5  | **Run-Time vs Compile-Time**          | How timing affects function defaults, decorators, and imports. |
| 6  | **Functions & Lambdas**               | Defining functions, *args/**kwargs, anonymous functions. |
| 7  | **Functional Programming Tools**      | Using `map()`, `reduce()`, `filter()`, and `zip()` in Pythonic ways. |
| 8  | **Closures**                          | Lexical closures and how Python retains context across function calls. |
| 9  | **Decorators**                        | What they are, how they work, and writing custom decorators. |
| 10 | **Imports, Modules & Packages**       | Absolute vs relative imports, `__init__.py`, and `__main__`. |
| 11 | **Tuples as Data Structures**         | Using immutable sequences for efficient data handling. |
| 12 | **Named Tuples**                      | Cleaner code with `collections.namedtuple` and type-safe fields. |
