No problem, Ravi! Let's break down the example step by step so it's crystal clear. Here's the input again:

```python
target = 10
position = [1, 4]
speed = [3, 2]
```

### 🚗 Car Details

| Car | Position | Speed | Time to Reach Target |
|-----|----------|-------|----------------------|
| A   | 1        | 3     | (10 - 1) / 3 = 3.0 hrs |
| B   | 4        | 2     | (10 - 4) / 2 = 3.0 hrs |

### 🧠 What Happens?

- **Car A** starts behind **Car B** but is faster.
- Both cars take **exactly 3 hours** to reach the destination.
- Since Car A catches up to Car B **at the destination**, they are considered part of the **same fleet**.

### ⛔ No Overtaking Allowed

Even though Car A is faster, it can't pass Car B. Instead, it catches up and drives at the same speed once it reaches Car B (if it catches up before the destination). But in this case, they arrive **together**, so they form **one fleet**.

### ✅ Final Answer

```python
Output: 1
```

Only **one fleet** reaches the destination.

# 🚗 Car Fleet Problem

## 📘 Problem Description

You are given a one-lane highway with `n` cars traveling toward the same destination. Each car has a starting position and a speed. Cars cannot pass each other but can catch up and form **fleets**—groups of cars traveling together at the same speed and position.

A **car fleet** is defined as:
- A non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and speed.
- A single car is also considered a fleet.
- If a car catches up to a fleet **exactly at the destination**, it is considered part of that fleet.

---

## 🧮 Inputs

- `target` *(int)*: The position of the destination in miles.
- `position` *(List[int])*: The starting positions of the cars.
- `speed` *(List[int])*: The speeds of the cars in miles per hour.

---

## 🎯 Output

- Returns the number of **distinct car fleets** that will arrive at the destination.

---

## 🧠 Example

```python
Input:
target = 10
position = [1, 4]
speed = [3, 2]

Output:
1
```

### Explanation:
- Car at position 1 with speed 3 will catch up to the car at position 4 with speed 2.
- They arrive at the destination together, forming **one fleet**.

---

## 🧪 Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 < position[i] < target <= 10^6`
- `0 < speed[i] <= 10^6`
- All positions are unique.

---

## 🧩 Approach Summary

1. **Sort cars** by starting position in descending order.
2. **Calculate time** each car takes to reach the destination.
3. **Simulate fleet formation**:
   - If a car takes longer than the one ahead, it forms a new fleet.
   - If it catches up before the destination, it joins the fleet ahead.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Sample Python Implementation

```python
def carFleet(target, position, speed):
    cars = sorted(zip(position, speed), reverse=True)
    times = [(target - pos) / spd for pos, spd in cars]
    
    fleets = 0
    prev_time = 0
    for time in times:
        if time > prev_time:
            fleets += 1
            prev_time = time
    return fleets
```

Perfect! Here's the same code rewritten with **clear inline comments** and a more beginner-friendly structure to help you understand each part:

---

### 🧑‍💻 Beginner-Friendly Python Code with Comments

```python
def carFleet(target, position, speed):
    # Step 1: Pair each car's position with its speed
    # Then sort cars by position in descending order (closest to target first)
    cars = sorted(zip(position, speed), reverse=True)

    # Step 2: Calculate time each car takes to reach the destination
    times = []
    for pos, spd in cars:
        time = (target - pos) / spd
        times.append(time)

    # Step 3: Count fleets using time comparison
    fleets = 0          # Total number of fleets
    prev_time = 0       # Time of the last fleet ahead

    for time in times:
        # If this car takes longer than the fleet ahead,
        # it can't catch up → forms a new fleet
        if time > prev_time:
            fleets += 1
            prev_time = time  # Update the slowest fleet time

    # Step 4: Return the total number of fleets
    return fleets
```

---

### 🧪 Example Walkthrough (Same as Before)

```python
target = 10
position = [1, 4]
speed = [3, 2]
```

- After sorting: `[(4, 2), (1, 3)]`
- Time to reach:
  - Car at 4: (10 - 4) / 2 = 3.0
  - Car at 1: (10 - 1) / 3 = 3.0
- Car at 1 catches up **exactly at the destination**, so they form **1 fleet**.

Absolutely, Ravi! Here's a clean and comprehensive **README** tailored for the version of the `carFleet` function you just shared. It explains the logic, usage, and structure of the code in a beginner-friendly way.

# 🚗 Car Fleet — Stack-Based Solution

## 📘 Problem Description

You are given `n` cars traveling toward the same destination on a one-lane highway. Each car has a starting position and a speed. Cars cannot pass each other but may catch up and form **fleets**—groups of cars driving together at the same speed and position.

A **car fleet** is:
- A non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and speed.
- A single car is also considered a fleet.
- If a car catches up to a fleet **exactly at the destination**, it becomes part of that fleet.

---

## 🧮 Inputs

- `target` *(int)*: The destination position in miles.
- `position` *(List[int])*: Starting positions of the cars.
- `speed` *(List[int])*: Speeds of the cars in miles per hour.

---

## 🎯 Output

- Returns the number of **distinct car fleets** that will arrive at the destination.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Python Implementation

```python
def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
    pair = [(p, s) for p, s in zip(position, speed)]  # Pair positions with speeds
    pair.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort cars from closest to target to farthest
    stack = []  # Stack to track fleet arrival times

    for p, s in pair:
        time = (target - p) / s  # Time to reach destination
        stack.append(time)

        # If the current car catches up to the fleet ahead, merge them
        if len(stack) >= 2 and stack[-1] <= stack[-2]:
            stack.pop()  # Remove the current car—it joins the fleet ahead

    return len(stack)  # Remaining times in stack = number of fleets
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Step 1**: Pair each car’s position with its speed.
- **Step 2**: Sort cars by position in descending order (closest to destination first).
- **Step 3**: Calculate time each car takes to reach the destination.
- **Step 4**: Use a **stack** to track fleet formation:
  - If a car arrives **later** than the one ahead, it forms a new fleet.
  - If it arrives **sooner or at the same time**, it merges into the fleet ahead.

---

## 🧪 Example

```python
Input:
target = 10
position = [1, 4]
speed = [3, 2]

Output:
1
```

### Explanation:
- Car at 1 (speed 3) and car at 4 (speed 2) both take 3 hours to reach the destination.
- Since they arrive together, they form **one fleet**.
