# Python 3: Deep Dive â€“ Part 2  
## Sequences, Iterables, Generators, and More

Welcome to **Part 2** of the *Python 3: Deep Dive* series. This section focuses on foundational concepts that power Pythonâ€™s data handling and flow control. If you want to level up your understanding of how Python works under the hood, you're in the right place.

## ðŸ§­ Topics Covered

### ðŸ“Œ Sequences
- Sequence types: `list`, `tuple`, `str`, `range`
- Immutability vs Mutability
- Indexing, slicing, and sequence operations
- Sequence protocol (`__getitem__`, `__len__`)

### ðŸ“Œ Iterables
- What it means to be iterable
- The iterable protocol: `__iter__`
- Iterating with `for` loops and manual iteration

### ðŸ“Œ Iterators
- The iterator protocol: `__next__`, `__iter__`
- Stateless vs Stateful iteration
- Creating custom iterators
- Handling `StopIteration`

### ðŸ“Œ Generators
- Generator functions using `yield`
- Generator expressions
- Lazy evaluation and performance benefits
- Use cases for pipelines and streams

### ðŸ“Œ Comprehensions
- List, set, and dictionary comprehensions
- Nested comprehensions
- Conditional expressions inside comprehensions
- Performance vs readability

### ðŸ“Œ Context Managers
- The `with` statement
- Context management protocol: `__enter__`, `__exit__`
- Creating custom context managers
- Simplifying with `contextlib`
